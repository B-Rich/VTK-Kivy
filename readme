# Integrating VTK into Kivy
# Contact: Brandt Westing (bmwesting@gmail.com)

This widget will allow you to render a VTK session onto an offscreen framebuffer, which can then be texturized onto a Kivy widget's Canvas element. This method uses a patched version of VTK that included a VTKRenderWindow that does no OpenGL initialization (thanks to Tito).

To make this work, you need to patch VTK and build it. You then need to make the pythonpath variable point to the correct VTK instance (the modified VTK)

Patch VTK:
git co git://github.com/bmwesting/VTK-Kivy.git
cd VTK-Kivy
wget http://www.vtk.org/files/release/5.8/vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
tar xvzf ../vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
cd VTK
patch -p1 < ../patch-vtk-embed-opengl-for-vtk-5.4.2.diff
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -i
